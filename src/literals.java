/*
now we are going to start new series of java coding section , in this section we will see about literal.
we will see the following literal in this block i.e = Integer literals, Floating-point literals, Boolean literals, character
literal, String literals.
now the question arise what do you mean by literals?
ans: A constant value in java is created by using a literal representation of it. for example: 100 = integer ,
98.6 = floating-pointer, x = character and etc....
